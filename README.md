This is the first i will build for the Odin Project

It is just HTML
			
It is a Recipes website			
						
By building it i am showing the skills i have learnt so far through the 
course

All seemed to go alright, the only bugs i had were some slight 
misspellings not reaching absolute addresses. Git had a bit of meltdown 
unrelated to me which i had to wait out but it gave me a chance to learn a 
bit more about it.

That was the main challenge. Getting used to the process of working and 
commiting things to GitX

So long
