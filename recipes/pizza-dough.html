            <p>I'm constantly looking up the ratio of flour to water for this - my cookbook opens automatically to this page</p>
            <P>Makes 4 Pizzas</P>

            <h2><b>Ingredients</b></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Packet of 7g dried yeast (10g if you can find any fresh stuff)</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon of sugar</li>
                <li>320ml of warm water</li>
                <li>500g pizza flour (mix of 00 and strong white)</li>
                <li>7g of salt</li>
                <li>Oil and extrra flour for kneading</li>
                <li>Semolina/polenta/cornmeal for baking</li>
                
           </ul>

           <ol>
                <li>Mix the yeast, water and sugar together and let sit until a bit bubbly</li>
                <li>Weigh the flour and salt into a big bowl. Mix </li>
                <li>Combine the liquid with dough just until a dough comes together</li>
                <li>Tip out to a floured or oiled surface and knead until the dough comes alive (usually about 10mins)</li>
                <li>Make sure the mixing bowl is clean and coat with Olive oil</li>
                <li>Put the dough in the oiled bowl, cover and leave in a warm place to rise</li>
                <li><p>After about 2 hours take out the dough and knock back a bit</p>
                    <p>Divide into 4 pieces and wrap really loosely in cling film, keep in fridge until you need to use it (will last at most 2 days, you can try more but that's all i'll risk)</p></li>
                <li>To use dust flat surface with semolina. Roll out and do some spinning (mainly for fun). try to get it as thin as possible</li>
                <li><p>If you've got a pizza oven awesome, you probably know how it works</p>
                <p>Otherwise turn your oven up as high it goes (mine can get to about 350 degrees C), cook your pizza (toppings your choice) on a preheated tray</p>
                <p>for about 10 mins or until the dough is crispy an slightly brown in places (might be longer or shorter depending on your oven)</p></li>
                
            
           </ol>
